## Minimal Laravel blog using Vue and GraphQL

The goal is to explore GraphQL. This project is minimal. The company I work for, uses GraphQL, so let's rock it.

Looks good, and even with this small project I can see some benefits over REST.

- You get the data you need
- Lighthouse made it so simple to avoid N+1 problems, so at least for now, nothing to worry about.
- It's EASIER , at least on the Frontend.

Let's see on the next bigger project!

A more advanced Laravel GraphQL project will come after this one.
